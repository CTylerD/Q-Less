## Tabletop Dice Game Web App

Q-Less is a recreation of the tabletop dice game [Q-Less](https://q-lessgame.com), which is a crossword like game where a dozen dice are rolled and then the user must make a crossword-esque diagram with the given letters. This game is dangerously addictive and now available digitally on the go!
